# Block Labeling Script

## Overview
The BlockLabeler script is designed to append a user-specified tag to the CustomNames of each block in a target grid. This eliminates ambiguity in the Control Panel when several grids are connected. It facilitates easy filtering of blocks that belong to specific grids; thereby reducing clutter within the Control Panel.

## Usage
1. Add a ProgrammableBlock (PB) to the target grid (viz., the grid whose block names are to be modified) or any grid that it is connected to.
2. Cut and paste the contents of [BlockLabeler.cs](https://github.com/Hewselhoff/SE-scripts/blob/main/code/scripts/blocklabeler/BlockLabeler.cs) into the "Edit" field of the PB.
3. Click "Check Code" and verify that the script compiles without error.
4. Click "OK.
5. Follow the instructions in the CustomData field and click "OK" when finished.
6. Click "Run."
